Bindings to the WASM Micro Runtime (WAMR)

The wasm-micro-runtime can be found at:
    https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime

If you cloned the submodules, the source code for the wamr can be conveniently 
found in:
    external/wasm-micro-runtime/

You'll need to build the library for your target platform. The header files 
may be found in:
    external/wasm-micro-runtime/core/iwasm/include/

Currently we only use wasm_export.h
